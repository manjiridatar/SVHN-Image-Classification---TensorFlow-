# SVHN-Image-Classification---TensorFlow- 

[Coursera - Getting started with TensorFlow 2 - Imperial College London](https://www.coursera.org/learn/getting-started-with-tensor-flow2/home/welcome "Getting Started with TensorFlow2 - Imperial College London")

We will use the SVHN dataset(http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/). This is an image dataset of over 600,000 digit images in all, and is a harder dataset than MNIST as the numbers appear in the context of natural scene images. SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images.

Our goal is to develop an end-to-end workflow for building, training, validating, evaluating and saving a neural network that classifies a real-world image into one of ten classes.

Learning Objectives for the course were: 
========================================
Part A - Inspect and preprocess the dataset

* Extract the training and testing images and labels separately from the train and test dictionaries loaded for you.
* Select a random sample of images and corresponding labels from the dataset (at least 10), and display them in a figure.
* Convert the training and test images to grayscale by taking the average across all colour channels for each pixel. Hint: retain the channel dimension, which will now have size 1.
* Select a random sample of the grayscale images and corresponding labels from the dataset (at least 10), and display them in a figure.

Part B - MLP neural network classifier

* Build an MLP classifier model using the Sequential API. Your model should use only Flatten and Dense layers, with the final layer having a 10-way softmax output.
You should design and build the model yourself. Feel free to experiment with different MLP architectures. Hint: to achieve a reasonable accuracy you won't need to use more than 4 or 5 layers.
* Print out the model summary (using the summary() method)
* Compile and train the model (we recommend a maximum of 30 epochs), making use of both training and validation sets during the training run.
* Your model should track at least one appropriate metric, and use at least two callbacks during training, one of which should be a ModelCheckpoint callback.
* As a guide, you should aim to achieve a final categorical cross entropy training loss of less than 1.0 (the validation loss might be higher).
* Plot the learning curves for loss vs epoch and accuracy vs epoch for both training and validation sets.
* Compute and display the loss and accuracy of the trained model on the test set.

Part C - CNN neural network classifier

* Build a CNN classifier model using the Sequential API. Your model should use the Conv2D, MaxPool2D, BatchNormalization, Flatten, Dense and Dropout layers. The final layer should again have a 10-way softmax output.
* You should design and build the model yourself. Feel free to experiment with different CNN architectures. Hint: to achieve a reasonable accuracy you won't need to use more than 2 or 3 convolutional layers and 2 fully connected layers.)
* The CNN model should use fewer trainable parameters than your MLP model.
* Compile and train the model (we recommend a maximum of 30 epochs), making use of both training and validation sets during the training run.
* Your model should track at least one appropriate metric, and use at least two callbacks during training, one of which should be a ModelCheckpoint callback.
* You should aim to beat the MLP model performance with fewer parameters!
* Plot the learning curves for loss vs epoch and accuracy vs epoch for both training and validation sets.
* Compute and display the loss and accuracy of the trained model on the test set.

Part D - Get model predictions

* Load the best weights for the MLP and CNN models that you saved during the training run.
* Randomly select 5 images and corresponding labels from the test set and display the images with their labels.
* Alongside the image and label, show each modelâ€™s predictive distribution as a bar chart, and the final model prediction given by the label with maximum probability.
